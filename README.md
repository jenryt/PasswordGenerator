# Password Generator

Work as an individual to build upon the base code.

* As a developer, I want to make sure the users have control over what criteria they’d like to include in their code, and the length of their code. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when users are prompted to the window that allow users to insert the length of there code and displays options for different criteria (Upper-case, Lower-case, numbers, Special Characters, etc) before they generate the code.

* It is done when users click on the “Generate Password” button, a randomized code is generated.
